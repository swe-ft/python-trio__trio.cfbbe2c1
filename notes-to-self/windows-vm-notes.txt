Have a VM in virtualbox

activate winenv here, or use py, py -m pip, etc.; regular python is
not in the path

virtualbox is set to map my home dir to \\vboxsrv\njs, which can be
mapped to a drive with: net use x: \\vboxsrv\njs

if switching back and forth between windows and linux in the same
directory and using the same version of python, .pyc files are a problem.
  find -name __pycache__ | xargs rm -rf
export PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1

if things freeze, control-C doesn't seem reliable... possibly this is
a bug in my code :-(. but can get to task manager via vbox menu Input
Keyboard -> Insert ctrl-alt-del.
